   2. PMID, Title, Abstract, ISSN, Journal, Location, Year, FirstAuthorForename, FirstAuthorLastname, FirstAuthorInitials, FirstAuthorAffiliation
3. 2nd file:
   1. All Authors info along with first author
   2. PMID,Author Position, First Name, Last Name, Initials, Affiliation
4. 3rd file
   1. Year Wise number of papers published




Problem Statements:


1. Company are looking at developing a new focus area in therapeutics around the infectious disease leptospirosis
2. We wish to make connections with researchers looking at this disease
3. determine who the key active researchers are in this field
4. avoid trying to work with researchers who are in competition with one another
5. build up a picture of who is working with who
6. Can you give us some graphics to present to the board on who are the most active researchers in this field, who they collaborate with, and how research in this area has changed over time?


Tasks


1. Who are the key researchers in leptospirosis 
   1. Graphics
2. Who is working with who
- similar titles
- similar affiliations
- same papers
- similar journals


3. How has this changed over time


Some observations of data:


1. Is keyword Leptospira is same as leptospirosis
2. 

Group Questions:


1. What could be the title of our project?
2. Tasks of the project?
3. Who will take a particular part?






Meeting Questions:
1. Are we allowed to use wider data? 
* For secondary analysis
2. What is expected to be shown as graphics? Few examples
* Demonstrate data of co-authorships and connections etc
3. What libraries are we allowed to use?
* Any
4. How do we identify competitors / do we need to identify if people are collaborating (same papers / institutions) or in competition.
* Count how often authors collaborate with each other as metric
* People who have co-authored with the same person
* Clumps of co-authors not connected
5. Can we use neural language programs for keyword analysis 
* For secondary analysis
6. For trying to determine if someone is a ‘key researcher’ should some research be held to higher standards based of word searchers than others. For example should papers that are reviews be seen as less ‘key’. 
* 7. Should we rank people based on their order number to see if some authors are more ‘key’  
*

Notes:


Initial Analysis
* All data is relevant
* Analyse all data
* Volume of papers published
* Whos working with who
* Just show appropriate visualisations


Secondary Part of Analysis
* Identify which journals are published in maybe
* Formal links between institutions
